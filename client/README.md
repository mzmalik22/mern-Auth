# React + Vite Authentication UI

This project provides a minimal, modern authentication UI built with React and Vite. The UI is now fully generic and does not contain any company or brand-specific elements. You can use it as a starting point for your own authentication flows.

## Features
- Login and registration forms
- Email verification and password reset flows
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Generic placeholder logo and no brand-specific text

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

Feel free to customize the UI, logo, and styles to fit your own project needs.
